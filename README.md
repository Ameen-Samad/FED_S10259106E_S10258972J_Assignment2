MokeSell:
    The website that we have created is mainly focused on selling and reselling shoes. Users can browse and buy shoes and not only that but they can also create their own listing. They can create an account for themselvses and login to the webiste, which stores their data such as their lisitngs if they choose to put up any.



Design Process:
    Before we started creating the website, we got inspired by novelships website while making our wireframes and hence, we decided to create a website that is user-friendly which focuses on shoes. The target audience for this website would be shoes enjoyer, these people would often buy shoes whether its for wearing them or collecting them and most importantly, they would also sell them. With our website, they would be able to do all of it from buying shoes to selling them as well. They can create an account for themselves and create a lisitng of their choice and upload it on to the website to sell them.

Testing:
    Contact Us Page:
    Go to the "Contact Us" page where there is a form you can fill up and try to submit the empty form and ensure that an error message about the required fields appears. After that input the correct details and a message that says successful should appear.

    In addition, you should mention in this section how your project looks and works on different browsers and screen sizes.
    On monitor. the website will look normal but when you minimize the browser to width 650, it will look different as compared to the full screen one as we have made it responsive by adding the @media.
